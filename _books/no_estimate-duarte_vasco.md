summary: |
  *How to always be on time, and not risk missing important deadlines or go over budget*

  This book is the result of many years of hard work, and plenty of lessons learned. I wrote it because I believe we can do better than the accepted "status quo" in the software industry.

  It took me years to learn what I needed to learn to come up with my version of the #NoEstimates approach. You can do it in weeks!

  The techniques and ideas described here will help you explore the #NoEstimates universe in a very practical and hands-on manner. You will walk through Carmen's story. Carmen is a senior, very experienced project manager who is now confronted with a very difficult project. One would say, an impossible project.

  Through the book, and with the help of Herman, Carmen discovers and slowly adopts #NoEstimates which helps her turn that project around. Just like I expect it will help with the project you are in right now. The book also includes many concrete approaches you can use to adopt #NoEstimates, or just adopt those practices on their own.
